 ANALYSIS OF INPUT DATA: 

                        PEDIGREE GWAS OPTION

 
                POSSIBLE OUTLIER INDIVIDUALS
 
 FOR EACH NON-PROBAND IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HIS/HER TRAIT
 VALUES GIVEN THE TRAIT VALUES OF OTHER PEDIGREE MEMBERS.  THESE
 PREDICTED VALUES CAN BE COMPARED TO THE OBSERVED VALUES BY
 COMPUTING AN APPROPRIATE QUADRATIC FORM.  THOSE INDIVIDUALS
 WITH P-VALUES FOR THE QUADRATIC FORM LESS THAN THE CUTOFF MAY
 BE OUTLIERS AND ARE LISTED BELOW.

                POSSIBLE OUTLIER PEDIGREES
 
 FOR THE NON-PROBANDS IN A PEDIGREE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO COMPUTE
 A QUADRATIC FORM WHICH UNDER A MULTIVARIATE NORMAL MODEL
 FOLLOWS AN APPROXIMATE CHI-SQUARE DISTRIBUTION.  THE DEGREES
 OF FREEDOM N EQUALS THE NUMBER OF MEASURED TRAIT VALUES AMONG
 THE NON-PROBANDS OF THE PEDIGREE.  UNDER A MULTIVARIATE T
 MODEL, THIS QUADRATIC FORM DIVIDED BY N FOLLOWS AN APPROXIMATE
 F DISTRIBUTION WITH DEGREES OF FREEDOM N AND V, WHERE V IS THE
 CONVERGED T PARAMETER.  THOSE PEDIGREES WITH P-VALUES FOR THE
 QUADRATIC FORM LESS THAN THE CUTOFF ARE LISTED BELOW.

                 EDF TESTS OF OVERALL FIT
 
 IN THE FOLLOWING STATISTICAL TESTS OF THE OVERALL FIT
 OF THE MODEL, THE P-VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PEDIGREE
 QUADRATIC FORMS ARE VIEWED AS RANDOM VARIABLES OR DEVIATES.

 IF THE CURRENT MODEL IS VALID, THESE DEVIATES SHOULD
 REPRESENT A RANDOM SAMPLE FROM A UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ON
 THE INTERVAL (0,1).  THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS USE THE
 EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION OF THE DEVIATES TO TEST FOR
 DEPARTURES FROM THE UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION.  SEE THE PAPER:
 M.A. STEPHENS, EDF STATISTICS FOR GOODNESS OF FIT AND SOME
 COMPARISONS. JASA (1974) 69:730-737.
