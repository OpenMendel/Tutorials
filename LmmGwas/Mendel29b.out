 IN THE FIRST FILTERING STAGE, NO INDIVIDUALS WERE REMOVED,
 AS NONE HAD A GENOTYPE SUCCESS RATE LESS THAN 0.980

 NO INPUT SNPS WERE REMOVED,
 AS NONE HAD A GENOTYPE SUCCESS RATE LESS THAN 0.980

 NONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE MISSING ALL QUANTITATIVE TRAITS.

 A TOTAL OF 253141 SNPS WILL BE ANALYZED.

 A TOTAL OF 212 INDIVIDUALS WITH SNP DATA WILL BE ANALYZED.
