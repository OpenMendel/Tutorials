    "## Overview\n",
    "Mendel Gamete Competition is a component of the umbrella [OpenMendel](https://openmendel.github.io) project. The gamete competition model is an application of the Bradley-Terry model and can be considered a parametric form of the TDT for use with pedigree data because, besides getting p-values, we also get a measure of the strength of the allelic associations. The Bradley-Terry model was originally applied to problems such as ranking teams in a sports league based on the intra-league win/loss records. In genetics, alleles assume the role of teams, and transmission parameters (the τ's) assume the role of the winning propensities [2](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelGameteCompetition.jl/#2), [3](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelGameteCompetition.jl/#3). As implemented in this version of OpenMendel, the gamete competition is an affected only association analysis and we assume the allele frequencies for the marker are known without error.  Let allele i be assigned a segregation parameter *τ<sub>i</sub>*, then the probability that a heterozygous parent with genotype *i = j* transmits allele i is the ratio *τ<sub>i</sub>/(τ<sub>i</sub>+τ<sub>j</sub>)*.  Because this ratio is invariant when *τ<sub>i</sub>* and *τ<sub>j</sub>* are multiplied by the same constant c, we need to impose the constraint that the most frequent allele k has segregation parameter *τ<sub>k</sub>* = 1. These propensities replace the normally used Mendelian segregation parameters for heterozygous parents' transmissions in the Elston-Stewart-Ott representation of the likelihood of the pedigrees.  In fact, under the null of no association between the marker and the trait in the gamete competition, Mendelian segregation ratios hold for heterozygous parents' transmissions so that *τ<sub>i</sub>*=1 is true for all alleles i and the likelihood reverts to the standard one. Note that the transmissions for homozygous parents always conform to standard Mendelian segregation ratios both under the null or alternative thus, like the TDT, only heterozygous parents are informative.  To test whether Mendelian segregation can be rejected, we estimate these τ's by maximum likelihood and conduct a likelihood ratio test. P-values are calculated assuming that the likelihood ratio test statistic is asymptotically chi square distributed. The degrees of freedom are equal to the number of alleles minus 1."

    "## When to use MendelGameteCompetition\n",
    "The Gamete Competition model applies to pedigrees, including those with missing marker data. With too many marker alleles computational efficiency suffers and large sample statistical assumptions become suspect. We recommend consolidating alleles until at most eight alleles remain and each has a frequency of 0.05 or greater. If the fraction of missing data is large, ethnic stratification may come into play. One remedy is to limit analysis to a single ethnic group; another is to use ethnic-specific allele frequencies. If you opt for the latter strategy, then you cannot simultaneously estimate allele frequencies and transmission parameters."
