    "### When to use Iterative Hard Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "*Continuous* model selection is advantageous in situations where the multivariate nature of the regressors plays a significant role *together*. Iterative hard-thresholing (IHT) performs continuous model selection on a GWAS dataset $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}^{n \\times p}$ and continuous phenotype vector $\\mathbf{y}$ by minimizing the residual sum of squares $f(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}||\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\beta||^2$ subject to the constraint that $\\beta$ is $k-$sparse. Parallel computing is offered through `q-`fold cross validation, and in the near future, dense (genotype matrix)-(dense vector) multiplication. "

    "### Appropriate Datasets and Example Inputs \n",
    "\n",
    "All genotype data **must** be stored in the [PLINK binary genotype format](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed), where the triplets `.bim`, `.bed` and `.fam` must all be present. Additional non-genetic covariates should be stored in a separate file (e.g. comma separated file). In this tutorial, we use \"gwas 1 data\" (github repo: [here](https://github.com/OpenMendel/MendelGWAS.jl/tree/master/docs)) to illustrate the functionalities of MendelIHT. This dataset has 2200 people and a modest 10000 simulated SNPs, with 2 SNPs (`rs1935681` and `rs2256412`) contributing to the response. One can obtain this dataset from the first example input of [MendelGWAS.jl](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelGWAS.jl/), or via option 24a of the free application [Mendel version 16](http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/mendel). \n"

    "\n",
    "`MendelIHT` assumes there are no missing genotypes, since it uses linear algebra functions defined in [SnpArrays.jl](https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/man/snparray/#linear-algebra-with-snparray). Therefore, you must first impute missing genotypes before you use MendelIHT. SnpArrays.jl offer a naive imputation strategy, but otherwise, our own software [option 23 of Mendel](http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/mendel) is a reasonable choice. Open Mendel will soon provide a separate package `MendelImpute` containing new imputation strategies such as alternating least squares.  "

    "### Cross Validation and Regularization paths\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually have very little information on how many SNPs are affecting the phenotype. In a typical GWAS study, anywhere between 1 to thousands of SNPs could play a role. Thus ideally, we can test many different models to find the best one. MendelIHT provides 2 ways for one to perform this automatically: user specified regulartization paths, and $q-$fold [cross validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics). Users should know that, in the first method, increasing the number of predictors will almost always decrease the error, but as a result introduce overfitting. Therefore, in most practical situations, it is highly recommended to combine this method with cross validation. In $q-$fold cross validation, samples are divided into $q$ disjoint subsets, and IHT fits a model on $q-1$ of those sets data, then computes the [MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) tested on the $qth$ samples. Each $q$ subsets are served as the test set exactly once. With noisy responses, IHT cross validation typically underestimates the true model size, as shown in an example below. "

    "According to our cross validation result, the best model size that minimizes out-of-sample errors (i.e. MSE on the q-th subset of samples) is attained at $k = 1$. Using this information, one can re-run the IHT code to obtain the estimated model. Note importantly, that cross-validation in this case **did not** return the true model size $k = 2$. This reflects the general tendency for IHT to *under* estimate the true model size, as highlighted in our [previous tutorial](https://github.com/klkeys/IHT.jl/blob/master/docs/IHT_tutorial_full.ipynb). Currently we are working hard to simulate varying datasets and model sizes to examine the behavior of using IHT. "

    "This notebook demonstrated some of the basic features of IHT. It will be informative to simulate known values of $\\beta$, because then we can compare reconstruction results directly. But in this notebook we instead chose to use a dataset that all other OpenMendel notebooks were using, with the values of $\\beta_{true}$ unknown. Interested readers can visit our older notebooks [here](https://github.com/klkeys/IHT.jl/blob/master/docs/IHT_tutorial_full.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/klkeys/IHT.jl/blob/master/docs/IHT_tutorial_brief.ipynb), which additionally runs IHT on numeric data. In the near future, we will release a more detailed tutorial that includes tutorials on all the experiemental features of IHT on GWAS data, as well as direct comparison results on simulated data. "
